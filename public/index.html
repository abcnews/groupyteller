                Here are 100 dots: each one represents 1 per cent of the Australian population — that's 240,000 people
                per dot.
              </p>
              <a name="markALIGNrightMEASUREissuesCOMPARISONnineteen"> </a>
              <p>
                Let's take a look at what you thought were the biggest <strong>issues</strong> for this election — the
                environment trumped the economy this time around.
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREissuesCOMPARISONsixteen"> </a>
              <p>
                It was a bit different in the 2016 election. Then, only 9 per cent of voters though the environment was
                the most important issue.
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREenvironmentCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p>
                The focus on the environment was very clear. When we asked people if the government should taken more
                action on climate change...
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREenvironmentCOMPARISONoverall"> </a>
              <p>...nearly all of you said <strong>more</strong> action was needed.</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREadaniCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p>
                On one of the most thorny environmental issues this election - we asked you whether the
                <strong>Adani mine</strong> in Queensland should be built.
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREadaniCOMPARISONoverall"> </a>
              <p>Nearly two thirds said they did not agree.</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREboatsCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p>
                "<strong>Stopping the boats</strong>" has been one of our most divisive issues since the 2013 election.
                And it still is.
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREboatsCOMPARISONoverall"> </a>
              <p>We asked whether boats carrying asylum seekers should be turned back. The response was split.</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREmulticulturalCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p>
                Nearly everyone supports one of the key principles of <strong>multiculturalism</strong> - that migrants
                can retain their cultural values without being any less Australian...
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREmulticulturalCOMPARISONonenation"> </a>
              <p>
                ...except One Nation voters. If there were 100 One Nation voters, this is what their views would look
                like.
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREmigrantsCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p>How many immigrants Australia should take was another divisive issue.</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREdrugtestingCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p>The Coalition have a controversial policy to give welfare recipients random drug tests.</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREdrugtestingCOMPARISONoverall"> </a>
              <p>A small majority of voters were in favour of drug-testing welfare recipients.</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREturnbullCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p>The Liberals went into this election after rolling PM <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong></p>
              <a name="markMEASUREturnbullCOMPARISONoverall"> </a>
              <p>Not many voters thought that was a good idea.</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREturnbullCOMPARISONgreens"> </a>
              <p>Especially not <strong>Greens</strong> voters</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREturnbullCOMPARISONlabor"> </a>
              <p>Or <strong>Labor</strong> voters</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREturnbullCOMPARISONcoalition"> </a>
              <p>
                Even <strong>Coalition</strong> voters did not think it a good idea - 58 per cent said NO. But there was
                one exception.
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREturnbullCOMPARISONonenation"> </a>
              <p>
                A majority of <strong>One Nation</strong> voters did think dumping Malcolm Turnbull was the right move.
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREparliamentCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p><strong>Women</strong> and <strong>men</strong> mostly, but not always, agreed with each other.</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREparliamentCOMPARISONwomen"> </a>
              <p>
                Women thought political parties should have rules that get <strong>equal numbers</strong> of men and
                women into <strong>Parliament</strong>.
              </p>
              <a name="markMEASUREparliamentCOMPARISONmen"> </a>
              <p>Men were not so keen on <strong>gender quotas</strong> for political parties.</p>
              <a name="markMEASUREeuthanasiaCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p>Everyone agrees on one issue though, regardless of party vote, age, income and even religion.</p>

              <p>
                Support for terminally ill patients to be able to end their own lives with medical assistance is very
                high.

              <a name="markMEASURErepublicCOMPARISONnone"> </a>
              <p>But don't expect Australia to become a Republic any time soon.</p>
              <a name="markMEASURErepublicCOMPARISONoverall"> </a>
              <p>Support for Australia ending the monarchy to become a republic is lukewarm at best.</p>
              <p>
                Vote Compass has provided a detailed snapshot of what the Australian electorate is thinking about this
                year. But surveys can never tell the whole story about how people will vote. All that matters is what
                the voters do in the ballot box on May 18.
